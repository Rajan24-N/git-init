# Hey Guys! ðŸ‘‹

## Activity

- Arrange yourself in groups of three
- Decide a *cool* team name ðŸŽ®
- Only one of the member forks this main repository (So, now it will be in your GitHub profile as member1-username/git-init)
- Please keep in mind you will now work on the forked repo only --> forget the main repository for the time being
- The rest of the two members are added as collaborators to the forked repository [How?](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

- All members of the team individually clone the repository (member1-username/git-init) to their systems
- All members add their personal name only to the `hello.txt` file.  
 Eg. Vinay will write only `Vinay Kakkad` as text to the file.
- Members will then add, commit and push the file

- After finally all three members push their texts to the file depending on your changes, you may or may not receive merge conflicts. (Reach out to us to know how to solve merge conflicts)

### The final result should look something like this
``` 
Name of your Team
Name 1
Name 2
Name 3
```

Once done, one of the members (any one) can generate a pull request to the main repository.
